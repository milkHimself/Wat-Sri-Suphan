1.I recommended to use XAMPP version 1.8.3 for the project
2.You need to edit httpd.conf, by Open XAMPP control panel -> Config (Beside 'Apache' text) -> Apache(httpd.conf). 
And add "AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .html" into the file. In order to make PHP code working on .html file
3.Don't forget to import the database file (the one that I uploaded on Facebook Group) first. And make sure that
"dbconfig.php" in /admin/class folder has been configured properly.

Any question other than that? You can ask me
